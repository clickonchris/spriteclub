== Backstory

This is an iframe based facebook game I written in 2011.  My uncle had this idea for a facebook app where you uploaded pictures of your kid and then challenge your friends to have a 'face-off' where you get all of your facebook friends to come and vote for who had the cutest kid.  He was very excited about it and asked me to build the app.  I had just seen 'The Social Network' at the time so I was sure that I would be able to build a killer app, get lots of users, and then make lots of money.

The day we launched over 100 users signed up.   I think we topped out somwhere around 150.

Obviously this app is not what you would call sucessful.  Perhaps because entering your kid into a facebook-based popularity contest is off-putting for a lot of people.  You get a lot of subtle negative reaction when I explained it to people.

Anywho, if anyone were interested in using the domain spriteclub.net and associated facebook app account I would be happy to hand them over.  There are worse ways to acquire 100 users.  email me - chris@clickonchris.com

This app uses  Rails 2.3.5 postresql, facebooker2, and paperclip.  Facebook api changes so fast that I think it's currently broken.
